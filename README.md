Welcome to _"Uptime? Nope."_ Where the aim of the game is to try and keep a Data Centre alive by trying to desperately keep up with the server demands of the increasing number of users accessing your data centre. All why trying to handle breaking server components.

Now, neither one of us is a modeller or artist and we haven't touched Unity in over a year, so this was always going to go well. :sweat_smile: Unsurprisingly, it turned out to be a bit of a disaster :rofl: 

## Instructions 
The aim of the game is to try and keep the data centre going as long as possible.  
  
Around the edge of the screen there are metrics on Number of Users, HDD Usage, Core Server Usage, Compute Server Usage, Profit and Current Money. The lower the combine server usage % the more profit you will make.  
  
In order to lower the usage % you will need to increase the capacity of the servers. To do this you will need to purchase additional parts from the computer. These parts will then appear on the delivery platform and you will need to pick them up and place them in their correct server slots.  
  
There is the chance of server component failure. If this happens that components will be disabled and the capacity will be decreased until the component is replaced.
